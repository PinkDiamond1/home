# Development teams alignment

## Weekly meeting

Every Tuesday at 11 CET, the development teams organize a development team alignment meeting.
Stakeholders  outside of the development teams are welcome to listen in but it's not the intention that they interfere or interrupt the meeting too much.

The purpose of this meeting is to:

- go over the priorities and deliverables of that week
- indicate or escalate blocking issues
- align dependencies between the teams

Each meeting is registered as an issue of type `type_meeting` and put in the project [Team alignment meetings](https://github.com/threefoldtech/home/projects/4).
Meetings can be prepared in the issue for the next meeting and meeting notes can traced in those issues as well.
