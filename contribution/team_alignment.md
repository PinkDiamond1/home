# Development teams Alignment

## Weekly meeting

Every monday at 11 CET, the development teams organize a development team alignment meeting.

Stakeholders  outside of the development teams are welcome to listen in but it's not the intention that they interefere or interrupt the meeting.

The purpose of this meeting is to:

- go over the priorities and deliverables of that week
- indicate or escalate blocking issues
- align dependencies between the teams
