### things that can be improved

 - every person was only involved in their own stuff; no sharing of experience
 - issues were not clear
 - defined sprint (no feature creep)
 - should not target non-devs and devs in the same solution. makes very confusing flows
 - no clear vision of the product. we end up adding and deleting and changing same stuff
 - no clear communication of plan/product vision
 - new features need to explain the experience required and the targeted audience as well as the flow if needed
 - no clear understanding of the business project plan
 - some PRs were not properly reviewed/approved too quickly
 - overworked team
 - need to use issues/PR templates more
 - one-page architectural overview diagram
