# blockchain & UI work

We have a lot of work to be done for user interface and today it goes too slow because of complexities with UI work in general as such we suggest to now implement a generic usable chat interface which can integrate with any of our requirements at backend.

RMB would be the protocol but signing needs to happen at client side (javascript maybe in tfconnect).
