# ThreeFold Grid v3.0.0 Alpha - 5

Sprint overview for TFGrid c3.0.0.0 Alpha-5

## TFNode-Pilot V0.1.0

Pocket Network is a blockchain data platform built for applications that uses cost-efficient economics to coordinate and distribute data at scale, enabling seamless interactions between blockchains and applications.

In order to deploy PoktNetwork to TF Terraform Grid Provider, we need to reverse engineer the Pokt node pilot into Node pilot light. It is a similar to node-pilot but open-source and stripped down. the scripts are being written into this [repository.](https://github.com/threefoldtech/node-pilot-light)

## TFT Shop v1.1.0

Project: https://github.com/threefoldfoundation/it_as_energy_shop/projects/9

On the first initial release of TFT Shop v1.0.0, we have made it easier for users to buy TFT by trading their BTC on our official [TFT Shop website](https://gettft.com/gettft/).

On this v1.1.0 release, we aim to give the users another option to buy TFT by using fiat currency. This will be made possible by integrating [mercuryo.io](http://www.mercuryo.io/) (third-party) widget onto the shop. By buying TFT using TFT Shop you confirm that you read and agree to [ThreeFoldâ€™s terms and conditions](https://library.threefold.me/info/legal/#/legal__terms_conditions_gettft).
