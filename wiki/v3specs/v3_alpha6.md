Sprint overview for TFGrid v3.0.0 Alpha-6


## TFNode-Pilot V0.1.0

In order to deploy PoktNetwork to TF Terraform Grid Provider, we need to reverse engineer the Pokt node pilot into Node pilot light. It is a similar to node-pilot but open-source and stripped down. the scripts are being written into this repository.
